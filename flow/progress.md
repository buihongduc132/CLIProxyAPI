# Sophisticated Formatter and LSP Setup

## Summary
Configured `.opencode/opencode.json` with formatter and LSP coverage for Go, Markdown, YAML, JSON, shell, PowerShell. Added helper scripts under `.opencode/scripts`. See verification steps below.

## Verification
- Pending: run `oqop --model <model> "say hello"` after `oqo models` to ensure provider visibility.
- Pending: spawn fresh `oqop` to validate tools.

## Next Steps
- Expand formatter coverage if new languages added.
